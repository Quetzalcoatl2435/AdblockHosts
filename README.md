# AdblockHosts
Create adblock host file for use with pihole or something else.

This is a simple app to combine multiple adblock host files into a single file which you can use with pihole or something similar.
You might even use it as basis for [serverless ad blocking using Cloudflare](https://blog.marcolancini.it/2022/blog-serverless-ad-blocking-with-cloudflare-gateway/).
